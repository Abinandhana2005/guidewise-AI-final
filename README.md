GuideWise AI: README
Project Overview
GuideWise AI is a productivity web application designed to help users manage their tasks, analyze their learning styles, and improve focus through the Pomodoro technique. It combines task management, motivational suggestions, and learning style analysis to help users achieve better outcomes during study or work sessions.

Features
Task Management: Add, track, and complete tasks with parameters like progress, confidence, estimated time, and priority.

Pomodoro Timer: Utilize a full-screen Pomodoro timer to work in focused intervals and receive motivational suggestions for breaks.

Learning Style Analysis: Analyze and understand your learning style based on inputs like mood, energy, distraction level, and sleep quality.

Notifications: Receive real-time toast notifications for task updates, Pomodoro completions, and learning style suggestions.

Technologies Used
React.js: For building the user interface.
React Toastify: For displaying notifications.
CSS: For custom styling of the interface.
Browser APIs: For full-screen mode and other UI interactions.
Installation
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/wowthrisha/ideathon_guidewiseai.git
cd ideathon_guidewiseai
Install Dependencies: Ensure that Node.js and npm are installed. Then, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Run the Application: After the installation, you can start the application using:

npm start
View the App: Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the app.

Usage
Task Management:

Add tasks by filling in the task name and adjusting the parameters (progress, confidence, estimated time, and priority).
View and manage tasks from the task list and mark them as complete once done.
Learning Style Analysis:

Input your current mood, energy, distraction level, and sleep quality.
The app will analyze your inputs and provide a personalized learning style suggestion with motivational advice.
Pomodoro Timer:

Start a Pomodoro session when you select a task.
The timer runs for 25 minutes and enters full-screen mode to help you focus.
You can pause the timer, log intrusive thoughts, or take breaks if distracted.
Customization
Sliders:

Sliders are used for inputting values like progress, confidence, and energy levels.
The slider bars are designed with white and orange colors to visually represent chosen and unchosen portions.
Full-Screen Mode:

The Pomodoro timer can be viewed in full-screen mode for distraction-free sessions.
Clicking the "Leave Study Session" button will exit the full-screen mode.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
